(Music Composition with deep learning: A review)\\
"Music is generally defined as a succession of pitches or rhythms, or both, in some definite pattern. Music composition (or generation) is the process of creating or writing a new piece of music. The music composition term can also refer to an original piece of work of music. Music composition requires creativity which is the unique human capacity to understand and produce an indefinitely large number of sentences in a language, most of which have
never been encountered or spoken before [2]. This is a very important aspect that needs to be taken into account when
designing or proposing an AI-based music composition algorithm."\\

(Music transcription modelling and composition using deep learning)\\
"The application of artificial neural networks to music modelling, composition
and sound synthesis is not new, e.g., [9, 17, 27, 37, 38]; but what is new is the
unprecedented accessibility to resources: from computational power to data, from
superior training methods to open and reproducible research. This accessibility
is a major reason “deep learning” methods [8, 25] are advancing far beyond
state of the art results in many applications of machine learning, for example,
image content analysis [24], speech processing [19] and recognition [16], text
translation [35], and, more creatively, artistic style transfer [13], and Google’s
Deep Dream. 5 As long as an application domain is “data rich,” deep learning
methods stand to make substantial contributions." \\

Deep learning is now being applied to music data, from analysing and mod-
elling the content of sound recordings [22,23,26,32–34,40,41], to generating new
music [3, 5, 33]. Avenues for exploring these directions are open to many since
powerful software tools are free and accessible, e.g., Theano [1], and compati-
ble computer hardware, e.g., graphical processing units, is inexpensive. This has
led to a variety of “garden shed experiments” described in a timely manner on
various public web logs. 6 The work we describe here moves beyond our informal
experiments 7 to make several contributions.
